# Heart-Disease-Analysis
A Tableau-based heart disease analytics project that visualizes medical and demographic attributes from a clinical dataset. The dashboard highlights risk factors, correlations, and patterns through interactive charts and filters to support data-driven health insights.


**Overview**

This repository contains an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze and visualize clinical indicators related to heart disease.
The project highlights patterns, risk factors, and demographic insights using real-world medical data.

**Project Goals**  
Identify key factors contributing to heart disease  
Enable interactive exploration of patient attributes  
Present insights in a data-driven and visualization-first format  
Improve understanding of health risk relationships for general audiences  

**Dataset Summary **
Source: UCI / Kaggle Heart Disease dataset  


**Features Analyzed**

Age & Gender  
Chest Pain Type  
Resting Blood Pressure  
Serum Cholesterol  
Fasting Blood Sugar  
Resting ECG Results  
Maximum Heart Rate    
Exercise-Induced Angina  
ST Depression  
Heart Disease Diagnosis (Target)  
You can update the feature list based on your dataset.  


**Dashboard Components**
The workbook includes the following analytical views:  
Demographic Insights  
Patient age distribution  
Gender-wise diagnosis comparison  

**Risk Indicators**

Cholesterol vs likelihood of heart disease  
Resting blood pressure analysis  
Maximum heart rate and stress performance  

**Correlation & Trends**

ST depression vs disease presence  
Chest pain type pattern analysis  
Exercise-induced angina comparison  
Interactive slicers and filters allow users to customize exploration.  

**Key Findings**

Patients in older age segments show higher disease probability  
High cholesterol and elevated resting BP strongly correlate with diagnosis  
Exercise-induced angina frequently aligns with positive heart disease detection  
Replace or expand based on your own observations.
